Project written in Python using Django 4.0.1 framework for engineering thesis. The web application allows you to
automatically generate academic lesson plans based on the availability of lecturers, class groups, classroom occupancy and
given details such as specific types of classes, the length of an hourly unit, and the length of breaks between classes. Each of
the lecturers can provide their hourly preferences as to the classes they conduct and, in addition to the plans of specific
groups / courses, they also have access to their personal plan combining all classes conducted by them. It's possible to
export the plan both as an external link and a PDF file.
